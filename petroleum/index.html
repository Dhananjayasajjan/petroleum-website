  <h2>Crude Oil Formation & History</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Formation of Petroleum</h1>
      <p>
      Petroleum is a fossil fuel formed naturally over millions of years beneath the Earth’s surface. It originates from the remains of microscopic marine organisms such as plants, algae, and plankton that lived in ancient seas. The formation of petroleum is a slow geological process that requires specific environmental conditions, including absence of oxygen, high pressure, and high temperature.      
      </p>
      <h1>Origin of Organic Matter</h1>
      <p>
      Millions of years ago, vast shallow seas covered large parts of the Earth. These seas were rich in microscopic life forms such as algae, plankton, and bacteria. These organisms absorbed carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis. At the end of their life cycle, they died and settled at the bottom of the seas.
      </p>
      <h1>Burial and Sedimentation</h1>
      <p>The dead organic matter accumulated on the seafloor and gradually mixed with mud, sand, and clay. Over time, continuous deposition of sediments buried the organic remains under thick layers of rock. The lack of oxygen in these buried conditions prevented complete decomposition of the organic matter.
      </p>
      <h1>Formation of Sedimentary Basins</h1>
      <p>As geological changes occurred, many ancient seas dried up, leaving behind large depressions known as sedimentary basins. These basins were filled with layers of sediments and organic material. Sedimentary basins are the primary locations where petroleum is formed and stored.
      </p>
      <h1>Effect of Heat and Pressure</h1>
      <p>As the organic material was buried deeper beneath the Earth’s surface, it was subjected to increasing temperature and pressure due to geothermal heat and the weight of overlying sediments. At great depths, oxygen was almost completely absent, and chemical changes began to occur in the buried organic matter.
      </p>
      <h1>Formation of Kerogen
      </h1>
      <p>Under moderate heat and pressure, the organic material was converted into a waxy, solid substance called kerogen. This stage of transformation is known as diagenesis. Kerogen is the main source material from which petroleum and natural gas are formed.
      </p>
      <h1>Conversion into Hydrocarbons</h1>
      <p>With further increase in temperature and pressure, kerogen underwent a process called catagenesis. During this stage, kerogen broke down into hydrocarbons, which are compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon. Depending on the conditions, different types of hydrocarbons were formed, including crude oil and natural gas.
      </p>
      <h1>Migration of Petroleum</h1>
      <p>The hydrocarbons formed were lighter than the surrounding rocks and fluids. As a result, they began to migrate upward through porous rocks such as sandstone. This movement continued until the petroleum encountered impermeable rock layers.
      </p>
      <h1>Trapping and Formation of Reservoirs</h1>
      <p>When petroleum was blocked by non-porous rocks like shale, it accumulated in underground pockets known as petroleum reservoirs. These reservoirs may be located beneath land or beneath the ocean floor. A typical reservoir contains oil, natural gas, and water arranged according to their densities.
      </p>
      <h1>Time Scale and Nonrenewable Nature</h1>
      <p>The entire process of petroleum formation takes millions to hundreds of millions of years. Since petroleum cannot be replenished within a human lifetime, it is classified as a nonrenewable source of energy.
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Petroleum is formed from ancient marine organisms through a complex geological process involving burial, heat, pressure, and chemical transformation. Its formation requires specific conditions over a very long period, making it a valuable but limited natural resource.

      <p>
        Petroleum is a naturally occurring fossil fuel formed over millions of years beneath the Earth’s surface.
        Ancient marine plants and animals settled on ocean floors and were buried under layers of sediment.
        Heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen transformed this organic matter into hydrocarbons.
      </p>

      <p>
        These hydrocarbons migrated through porous rocks and accumulated beneath impermeable layers,
        forming oil reservoirs. These reservoirs are the primary sources of crude oil extraction today.

      <h3 id="history-tech">Historical Development of Extraction Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Commercial petroleum extraction began in 1859 with Edwin Drake’s oil well in Pennsylvania.
        Early methods relied on shallow drilling and manual tools. As oil demand increased,
        rotary drilling, steel casing, and advanced rigs replaced primitive systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 20th century introduced seismic surveys, offshore platforms, and automated drilling.
        Modern extraction uses 3D seismic imaging, directional drilling, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
        to maximize output while improving safety.
      </p>

      <h3 id="start-process">Where and How Extraction Begins</h3>
      <p>
        Extraction begins with geological exploration using seismic waves to locate underground reservoirs.
        Once confirmed, drilling rigs penetrate rock layers while blowout preventers ensure safety.

      <p>
        <i>By a Special Energy Correspondent</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Crude petroleum’s journey does not end when it is discovered beneath the Earth’s surface.
        Extraction is only the first step. From remote deserts, frozen tundras, and deep oceans,
        crude oil travels thousands of kilometers through a high-risk, tightly regulated global
        transportation network.
      </p>

      <img src="images/oil-transport-overview.png" alt="Oil Transportation Overview">

      <h3 id="collection-site">Stage 1: Collection at the Drilling Site</h3>
      <p>
        Once extracted, crude oil is collected at the wellhead. At this stage, it is untreated,
        highly flammable, and mixed with natural gas, water, sand, and sediments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Onshore wells use steel storage tanks</li>

      <h3 id="pipeline-transport">Stage 2: Pipeline Transportation – Arteries of the Oil Industry</h3>
      <p>
        Pipelines are the most widely used and cost-effective method for transporting crude oil.
        Oil flows due to pressure differences maintained by pumping stations every 50–150 kilometers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern pipelines operate 24/7 using sensors, satellite monitoring, and leak-detection software.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Gathering Pipelines:</b> Connect wells to collection stations</li>
        <li><b>Transmission Pipelines:</b> Transport oil across countries</li>
        <li><b>Subsea Pipelines:</b> Carry oil from offshore platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Nearly 20% of global oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz daily, making pipeline security
        a geopolitical priority.

      <h3 id="refinery-intro">Inside the Refinery Gates: How Crude Oil Is Processed</h3>
      <p><i>By an Energy & Industry Correspondent</i></p>

      <p>
        Crude oil, fresh from the depths of the Earth, is unusable in its raw form.
        Thick, volatile, and chemically complex, it must pass through massive industrial
        systems before becoming petrol, diesel, aviation fuel, or plastic.
        This transformation takes place inside oil refineries—among the most strategically
        critical industrial facilities in the modern world.
      </p>

      <img src="images/oil-refinery-overview.png" alt="Oil Refinery Overview">

      <h3 id="refinery-arrival">What Happens When Crude Oil Reaches a Refinery?</h3>
      <p>
        Crude oil arrives at refineries via pipelines, tanker ships, or rail systems.
        Once unloaded into massive storage tanks, samples are tested for density,
        sulfur content, and impurity levels. The refining pathway depends on crude quality.
      </p>

      <h3 id="pre-treatment">Stage 1: Pre-Treatment – Cleaning the Crude</h3>
      <p>
        Before refining begins, crude oil must be cleaned to protect refinery equipment.
        This process, known as desalting, removes water, salt, sand, and corrosive metals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crude oil is mixed with fresh water, heated, and passed through electrostatic separators.
        Only after this process is crude oil safe for distillation.
      </p>

      <img src="images/crude-desalting.png" alt="Crude Oil Desalting Process">

      <h3 id="distillation">Stage 2: Atmospheric Distillation – Separating the Crude</h3>
      <p>
        The first major refining step is atmospheric distillation.
        Crude oil is heated to about <b>400°C</b> and fed into a tall distillation tower.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>LPG</b> – rises to the top</li>
        <li><b>Petrol (Gasoline)</b></li>
        <li><b>Kerosene / Jet Fuel</b></li>
        <li><b>Diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>Heavy fuel oil</b> – settles at the bottom</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This stage separates crude oil physically without altering its chemical structure.
      </p>

      <img src="images/distillation-column.png" alt="Atmospheric Distillation Column">

      <h3 id="secondary-processing">Stage 3: Secondary Processing – Breaking Heavy Oil</h3>
      <p>
        Heavy fractions are processed further using advanced conversion technologies:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Cracking:</b> Breaks large hydrocarbon molecules</li>
        <li><b>Catalytic Cracking:</b> Maximizes petrol output</li>
        <li><b>Hydrocracking:</b> Uses hydrogen for ultra-clean fuels</li>
        <li><b>Coking:</b> Converts residue into petroleum coke</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These processes determine whether a refinery is basic, complex, or deep-conversion.
      </p>

      <h3 id="blending">Stage 4: Treating & Blending – Meeting Global Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Fuels must meet strict emission and performance regulations.
        Refineries remove sulfur, nitrogen compounds, and heavy metals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different components are blended to achieve correct octane ratings,
        climate-specific performance, and international environmental compliance.
      </p>

    
      <h3 id="storage-export">Stage 5: Storage, Distribution & Export</h3>
      <p>
        Finished fuels are stored in large tanks before being transported via pipelines,
        loaded onto tankers, or exported globally.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this stage, crude oil has fully transformed into usable energy products.
